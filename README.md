# What is this?

This is a Slope clone that I added my own tweaks and improvements to. Optimized for slower computers and school environments.

This client is currently hosted at:
- [github.io](https://calebh101.github.io/slope) (sorta-nightly build)
- ~~[my website](https://slope.calebh101.com) (stable build)~~ (coming soon)

# Features

This Slope client uses the original Slope game, but has several addons/features:

- No ads/trackers
- Blocks ads/trackers from the Slope embed (beta)
    - This works by using a CSP (Content Security Policy).
- Includes color themes
    - Normal: normal theme
    - Blue and Orange (beta, since it increases brightness to get a nice shade so it looks a bit weird)
    - Pink and Blue
    - Orange and Purple (my personal favorite)
    - Monochrome (black and white)
- Includes a tab masker
- Includes a quick button to open a fake website (like Google Classroom)
